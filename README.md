# Reverse Engineering the Hacker News Ranking Algorithm

This repository is a companion to the article [Reverse Engineering the Hacker News Ranking Algorithm](http://sangaline.com/post/reverse-engineering-the-hacker-news-ranking-algorithm).
The article explores the process of figuring out how the Hacker News Ranking Algorithm works using historical data.
You probably want to read that either before or in tandem with the analysis code included in this repository in order to develop an understanding of the notation, derivations, and general context.

After you've done that, you can check out [the analysis notebook](Reverse%20Engineering%20the%20Hacker%20News%20Ranking%20Algorithm.ipynb) which walks through the full analysis process.
The corresponding data is also included in this repository so you should be able to run the existing analysis yourself or extend it however you see fit.
